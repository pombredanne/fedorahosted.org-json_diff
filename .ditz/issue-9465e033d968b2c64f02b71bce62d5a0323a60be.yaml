desc: |-
  Some properties must be excluded. I.e., piglit's JSON produces a lot of
  time properties which are not interesting.

    Fixed as part of larger first working version.
    Programmatically fill excuded_attributes tuple, or add (even repeatedly)
    -x parameter to the command line. So,
    
    json_diff.py -x spam old.json new.json
    
    Ignores all mentions of the horrendous stuff.
