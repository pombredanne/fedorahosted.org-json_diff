    Right, this code
            for name in keys:
                # Explicitly excluded arguments
                logging.debug("name = %s (inc = %s, excl = %s)", name,
                                unicode(self.included_attributes), unicode(self.excluded_attributes))
                if ((self.included_attributes and (name not in self.included_attributes)) or
                        (name in self.excluded_attributes)):
                    continue
                # old_obj is missing
    is wrong. We need to dive into all dictionaries and arrays and only down there
    to decide.
